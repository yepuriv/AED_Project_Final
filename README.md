CLOTHES DONATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

People who are homeless often wind up wearing dirty and wet clothes for long stretches of time, making them vulnerable to the spread of transmissible disease, including Covid-19. The situation worsens during the winter. So, cloth donation is a very important gesture that helps millions of people. Therefore, we have decided to develop an application for managing clothes donation using Java Swing and our datbase for this project is db40.
